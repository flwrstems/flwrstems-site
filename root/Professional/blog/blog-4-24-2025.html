				I'm into building things on the internet to make it a better place. This website is a project to play with  
                technology and share my inherently valuable identity in a cohesive manner. I work with 
                <a href="https://fedihosting.foundation">fedihosting.foundation</a> to provide decentralized platforms for speech
                 on the internet. I'm into self-hosting! There are so many people developing 
                 <a href = "https://github.com/rping-qwfpgj?tab=stars">cool software!</a> I tried to host a
                 <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/"> Mastodon </a>instance on my small VPS, but it wouldn't boot with only a gig
                  of ram dedicated to the system. I'd love to run a Tor Network node or bridge, but for now I am content with 
                  running a <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">snowflake</a> proxy in my browser. I'm also 
                  looking into hosting a <a href = "https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a> database and implementing ActivityPub/AT protocol/Webmentions on my server 
                  to <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE" >syndicate</a> my content out to the world. Or perhaps I will host a 
                  Plex server, or a platform to host git repositories. I've talked with <a href="https://dawnvoid.neocities.org">Dawn</a> 
                  about hosting a BBS or IRC server.

				Eventually I would like to work with an organization enabling privacy and circumnavigating authoritarian 
                censorship on the internet. Ex: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor Project</a>, <a href = 
                "https://proton.me/">Proton</a>, <a href = "https://psiphon.ca/">Psiphon</a>.

				Also, check <a href="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/">this</a> 
                out. Repurposing/hacking old hardware is badass. I'm talking with Dawn about implementing 
                a status page like this for <a href="https://gooptech.nya.pub">gooptech !!</a>. I hacked my 3ds using 
                <a href = "https://github.com/hacks-guide/MSET9">this</a> script. Someone wrote an http server for the 3ds, 
                maybe I'll copy Alex Haydock's experiment.
